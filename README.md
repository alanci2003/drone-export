# Drone Export Dashboard

This project provides a simple Gradio interface for processing drone export data. Upload a raw CSV file encoded in Big5 and the app will preprocess the data, generate six visualizations, and allow you to download the resulting files.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Upload Big5-encoded customs data
- Translate country names to English
- Convert ROC dates to Gregorian ``yyyy/mm`` and map to quarters
- Scale export value from thousands of USD to actual amount
- Group low-volume countries as ``Other`` for readability
- Download the cleaned CSV and all generated charts

Run the application with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
This app automatically generates six types of drone export visualizations:
1. **Drone Unit Counts** â€” Total drones exported by quarter and destination country (stacked bar).
2. **Drone Unit Share (%)** â€” Percentage share of drones exported to each country per quarter.
3. **Export Value ($K)** â€” Export value (in thousands of USD) by country and quarter.
4. **Export Value Share (%)** â€” Proportion of export value per country per quarter.
5. **2023H2 vs 2024H2 Comparison** â€” Unit share and export value share across two half-year periods.
6. **2023H2 vs 2025Q1 Comparison** â€” Unit share, value share, unit count, and value count across three periods.

All plots are downloadable as high-resolution PNGs and the underlying data is also exported as CSVs.
